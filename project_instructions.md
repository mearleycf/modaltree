## (6) AI Instructions

* Never do unprompted changes. Only make changes I've instructed you to make. For example, if there is code we need to refactor, and I don't tell you to refactor it, don't refactor it. If there are functions/methods we haven't implemented yet, don't implement them until I ask you to.

* MCP Server Tools
   * Don't use these tools on this project:
      * any obsidian tool
      * flashcard-server
   * Use these tools on this project, explicitly:
      * git
      * filesystem
      * github
      * mcp-knowledge-graph
      * llm-context
      * sequential-thinking
      * *aindreyway-mcp-neurolora*
      * fetch
      * *modelcontextprotocol-server-brave-search*
      * *ai-humanizer-mcp-server*
